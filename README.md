This is a project to make people shut up. 

There are two files.


The first file, pico.py, sets up the threshold for the pico and allows data to properly go from Mic to Pico and then to Pi4 in the next file


The second file, raspberry-pi-in.py, sets what happens with the data. It prints what is happening and can tell you who is speaking if the speaking is out of turn.



you should install x file on a pico and y file on a rpi, you can take a look at my science project for the complete procedures.
