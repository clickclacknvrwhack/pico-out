This project's pupose was to be able to tell who was speaking if they were doing so out of turn. 

There are two files.

The first file, pico.py, sets up the threshold for the pico and allows data to properly go from Mic to Pico and then to Pi4 in the next file


The second file, raspberry-pi-in.py, sets what happens with the data. It prints what is happening and can tell you who is speaking if the speaking is out of turn.


you should install pico.p file on a pico and aspberry-pi-in.py file on a rpi4, you can take a look at my science project for the complete procedures.
